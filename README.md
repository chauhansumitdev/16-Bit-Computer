## About

**riser16** is a 16-bit computer project that visualizes the low-level workings of computers. This project follows a Von Neumann architecture, using a common bus for both data and addressing. The complete description of its architecture and specifications are as follows:

## Hardware Specifications:
- **Architecture**: Von Neumann with a common data and address bus.
- **Word Size**: 16-bit.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: 8 modes.
- **Flag Registers**: 2 flags - Carry and Zero.
- **General Purpose Registers**: 2 registers - X and Y.
- **RAM Size**: 64KB (2^16).
- **Microinstruction Cycle**: Maximum 16 cycles for NOP (No Operation) and minimum 3 cycles for SKIP.
- **Display**: Two types - Hex display and 256x128 pixel display.
- **Instruction Set Capacity**: Complex instruction set with 256 (2^8) possible instructions.
- **Turing Complete**: Yes.

## Features:
- **Von Neumann Architecture**: This architecture allows both data and instructions to be stored in the same memory space, simplifying the design and operation of the computer.
- **16-bit Word Size**: Enables the processing of larger amounts of data in a single operation compared to smaller word sizes.
- **ALU**: The 8-mode ALU provides flexibility in performing various arithmetic and logic operations.
- **Flag Registers**: Carry and Zero flags are essential for arithmetic operations and branching decisions.
- **General Purpose Registers**: X and Y registers offer data storage for operations.
- **Large Memory**: 64KB RAM provides ample space for programs and data.
- **Efficient Microinstruction Cycle**: Optimized for both simple and complex operations, balancing speed and functionality.
- **Dual Display**: The Hex display and pixel display enhance the visualization of data and operations.
- **Complex Instruction Set**: Supports a wide range of operations, making it suitable for complex computational tasks.
- **Turing Completeness**: Capable of performing any computation given enough time and resources, demonstrating its power and flexibility.

## How to run this project?
